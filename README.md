# Predicting Logic Gates Output

Purpose of the project is to get a hand on Neural Networks through a basic task with trivial inputs/outputs
It is merely to educate myself on various parts that I don't know about CS.

## Setup

To setup the project on your local machine:

1. Click on `Fork`.
2. Go to your fork and `clone` the project to your local machine.
3. `git clone https://github.com/Guilyx/neural-network-logicgates.git`
4. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Run

To run the project:
1. Cd into the root of the project `cd path/neural-network-logicgates`
2. Run the main script with necessary args : `python src/main.py gate=or mode 'network'`

Accepted values for the gate argument are : or, OR, and, AND, nor, NOR, nand, NAND, xor, XOR
Accepted modes are : network, perceptron
